    <h1>Earlier we met on Snapchat, we didn't know when the little things turned into completely different things and every single thing started getting shared. <br>
        Even in such a distance, there were feelings of living together,we both had got so mixed as if we are old friends. <br>
        Then we both became friends from stranger and slowly from friends to best friends and our bond became stronger. <br>
        may be im unlucky in relationship But i think i'm luckiest person in the world Because i have the <br>
        Best And most cute, supportive girl as My BESTFRIEND.
